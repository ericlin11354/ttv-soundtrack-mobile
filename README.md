This repo is based on React Native's default "AwesomeProject"

The goal is to create a app to quickly access TwitchTV's Soundtrack web player on mobile. InAppBrowser is used to embed the HTML page.

No APK has been provided. Please `npm run android` to install the app.

Note: This is intended to work on Android. iOS has not been tested.

If you have trouble installing the app, consider:

- Run `npm install` to install/reinstall packages.
- Changing your node version.
- Remove all virtual/physical devices besides the target device for installation.
- Follow the steps [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for more info on setting up a development environment.
